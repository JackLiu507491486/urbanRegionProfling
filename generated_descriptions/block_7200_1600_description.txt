The area is characterized by a mix of transportation infrastructure, agricultural/industrial activities, and limited public services. Transportation is supported by multiple bus stops, parking facilities (specifically within the "练塘服务区"), and gas/electric vehicle charging stations. Agricultural and industrial activities are represented by farms, agricultural cooperatives, and manufacturing companies. Public services include public restrooms, a primary school branch, and local government offices. The presence of convenience stores and restaurants, largely within the "练塘服务区," suggests a service-oriented function associated with the transportation infrastructure. The spatial layout appears to integrate agricultural/industrial zones with transportation-related services and limited community facilities.
