The area, defined by the latitude and longitude ranges [121.385238, 31.102114] - [121.405901, 31.120414] and encompassing 1645 POIs, is characterized by a mixed-use urban environment. A significant proportion of POIs are related to transportation infrastructure, including numerous bus stops along major roads such as 莘朱路, 莘吉路, 高兴路, 都市路, 畹町路, and 春申路. The area also contains a high density of parking facilities, ranging from public and roadside parking to dedicated parking for residential buildings, hotels and commercial centers.

The area exhibits a strong residential component, as indicated by the presence of many residential complexes like 上海春城, 名都新城, 春申复地城, 万科假日风景, and 莘南花苑. This is further supported by community service facilities such as居委会, 物业管理处, and community service stations.

Commercial activity is evident through the presence of supermarkets (农工商超市, 联华超市, 大润发), convenience stores (全家便利店, 快客), various retail stores (clothing, shoes, jewelry, electronics, home goods) and shopping centers (宝燕商城). A variety of dining options are also present, including Chinese restaurants (四川菜, 上海菜, 海鲜酒楼), fast food chains (肯德基, 永和大王), and bakeries (克莉丝汀, 85度C).

Additional functions within the area include: educational institutions (kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, training centers), healthcare facilities (华东医院闵行门诊部, 春申口腔门诊部, community health service stations, pharmacies), and recreational facilities (梅陇镇文化体育中心, 健身 centers, swimming pools,棋牌室,网吧). Financial services are provided by various banks (中国建设银行, 中国工商银行, 交通银行) and insurance companies. Automotive services, such as fueling stations, charging stations, repair shops, and car washes, are also represented.

The spatial layout appears to be a mix of planned residential areas interspersed with commercial zones and service facilities along major roads. The presence of industrial companies and business centers suggests some degree of economic activity beyond retail and services.
