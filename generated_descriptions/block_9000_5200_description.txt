The area is characterized by a concentration of industrial and manufacturing companies, particularly in the chemical and related sectors. This is further supported by the presence of logistics and warehousing services, research institutions focused on petrochemicals, and governmental agencies overseeing the chemical industry, including inspection and quarantine services, and public safety departments. The area also contains supporting infrastructure such as a sports complex (including a golf course and a general sports facility), a botanical garden, and a limited number of service facilities such as a restaurant, a general life service location and electric vehicle charging stations. The presence of a parking lot suggests some level of public accessibility, while the overall composition points towards a specialized industrial zone.
