The area defined by the coordinates [121.566278, 31.609455] - [121.587084, 31.627729] is characterized by a mix of transportation infrastructure, administrative functions, industrial/agricultural activities, and limited public services. Transportation is heavily represented by numerous bus stops (including "招呼站"), suggesting a reliance on public transit. The presence of village committees and Communist Party branches indicates local administrative functions. Several companies related to manufacturing (服饰, 橡塑制品, 轴瓦, 塑料制品), agriculture (养猪专业合作社), and a driver training school point to a combination of industrial and agricultural activities within the area. A memorial site (烈士公墓) provides a public service.
