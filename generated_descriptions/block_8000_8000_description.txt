The area is characterized by a mix of industrial, logistics, residential, governmental, educational, and commercial functions. A significant portion of the POIs are categorized as companies and factories, including mechanical, electrical, plastics, food, furniture, and shipping-related businesses. This indicates a substantial industrial presence. The presence of several logistics companies and warehouses, including bonded and general logistics facilities, suggests a strong focus on warehousing and distribution. Several residential POIs (dormitories, residential communities) and public services (public restrooms, environmental management) are also present. Educational facilities (kindergarten, middle school) and local government institutions indicate a community support structure. Limited retail and service businesses provide basic amenities. The presence of a bus stop suggests the availability of public transportation.
