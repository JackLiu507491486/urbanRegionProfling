The area is characterized by a mix of industrial, agricultural, commercial, and residential functions. The primary land use appears to be industrial, evidenced by the numerous factories and companies spanning various sectors including metalworking, machinery, construction materials, and food production. Agricultural activity is indicated by the presence of agricultural cooperatives and a dairy farm. Commercial activities are present, including logistics services, building material sales, convenience stores, and restaurants. Transportation infrastructure is represented by bus stops and a parking lot. Limited residential presence is suggested by a village health clinic. The POIs are spatially distributed to accommodate the co-existence of these different functions.
