A significant portion of the POIs are dedicated to commercial activities, including a diverse range of retail shops (clothing, food, electronics, building materials) and services (automobile, logistics, advertising, real estate). A substantial number of companies and factories also operate within the area, indicating industrial and manufacturing presence. In addition, the area contains educational institutions (schools, training centers), recreational facilities (sports venues, entertainment centers), accommodation options (hotels, guesthouses), healthcare services (clinics, pharmacies), and government/community organizations. This suggests a blend of commercial, industrial, residential, educational, recreational, and administrative functions, typical of a suburban or mixed-use urban area. The spatial layout appears to be a combination of concentrated commercial zones (e.g., "易家中心") and more dispersed industrial and residential areas.
