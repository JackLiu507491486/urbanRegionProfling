The area defined by the given coordinates presents a mixed land use pattern. A significant portion of the area is dedicated to agricultural and recreational activities, evidenced by numerous "草莓园" (strawberry farm) POIs, including采摘园 (picking gardens),农家乐 (agritourism), and other农林牧渔基地 (agricultural and aquacultural bases). This agricultural focus is further supported by the presence of agricultural cooperatives and research facilities.

Alongside agriculture, the area contains a collection of industrial and commercial companies, including manufacturing, trading, and equipment companies.

The area also includes essential community services and infrastructure, such as公交车站 (bus stops),公共厕所 (public toilets),社区综合服务中心 (community center),小学 (elementary school), and诊所 (clinic), as well as government and political organizations.
