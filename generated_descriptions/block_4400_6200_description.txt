The area is characterized by a mixed-use environment, primarily featuring residential, commercial, and exhibition functions. A significant portion of the POIs is dedicated to transportation infrastructure, including numerous parking facilities (entrances, exits, public and roadside parking), bus stops, and a subway station (花木路站) with multiple entrances/exits. This suggests a high volume of traffic and a need for diverse transportation options.

Commercial activity is evident through the presence of several shopping malls (浦东嘉里城, 证大大拇指广场, 联洋广场, 博览汇广场), supermarkets (家乐福), various retail stores (clothing, jewelry, electronics), and a wide array of restaurants and cafes.

The presence of the 上海新国际博览中心 (Shanghai New International Expo Centre) indicates a prominent exhibition function, supported by associated infrastructure such as parking and public transportation.

Residential areas are represented by numerous apartment complexes and villa communities (e.g., 汤臣湖庭花园, 浦东世纪花园, 四季雅苑), suggesting a substantial residential population.

Other notable functions include: accommodation (hotels and serviced apartments), recreational facilities (健身 centers, 游泳 pools, a cinema, and 世纪公园), public services (community health center, public toilets), and various companies/enterprises spanning diverse sectors.

The spatial layout appears to integrate residential zones with commercial centers and the exhibition venue, supported by a comprehensive transportation network.
