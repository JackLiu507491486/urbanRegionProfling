The area is characterized by a mix of industrial, commercial, residential, and transportation functions. A significant portion of the POIs are companies involved in various industries, including manufacturing, technology, agriculture, and construction. The presence of industrial parks further supports this. Transportation infrastructure is well-represented with roads, intersections, bus stops, and a port. Limited retail and dining options are present, along with a hotel, a clinic, and local government facilities. The area appears to be a mixed-use zone with a strong industrial component, supported by necessary infrastructure and basic services.
