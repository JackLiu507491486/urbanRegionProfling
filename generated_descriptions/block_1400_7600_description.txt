The area, defined by the coordinates [121.694513, 31.484531] - [121.715318, 31.502784], contains a single identified Point of Interest (POI): a convenience store named "东丰杂货商店" (Dongfeng General Store). This suggests a potential residential or mixed-use area where local shopping services are present to meet the daily needs of the population. The presence of only one POI limits further characterization of the area's functions and spatial layout beyond this local retail provision.
