The area is characterized by a mix of transportation infrastructure, commercial services, and limited residential/recreational facilities. A significant portion of the POIs are related to the "Ye Xie Service Area," which includes multiple parking lots, public toilets, gas stations (China Petrochemical Corporation), charging stations (under construction), convenience stores (including Easy Joy), a supermarket, restaurants (including Wu Fang Zhai), and a bookstore/fruit stand. Other POIs indicate the presence of a nursing home, a community service center ("Sunshine Home"), a school, a fishing location, and a company. The spatial layout appears to be centered around the service area, with some peripheral residential or recreational elements.
