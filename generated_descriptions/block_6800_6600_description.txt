The area is characterized by a mix of industrial, agricultural, governmental/community, and transportation-related Points of Interest (POIs). A significant portion of the POIs are company enterprises, including manufacturing, agricultural, and trading companies. The presence of agricultural entities like farms and cooperatives, alongside factories and industrial companies, indicates a blend of agricultural and industrial activities. Several bus stops and a road intersection suggest a focus on transportation infrastructure. Community facilities, such as village committees, community centers, schools, and elderly activity centers, are present, along with basic shopping services and a health clinic. This suggests the area serves as a local residential and employment hub.
