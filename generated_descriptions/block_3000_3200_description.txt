The functions of the POIs indicate the area supports daily living needs (grocery stores, pharmacies), personal services (hair salons, beauty parlors, cleaning services), and recreational activities (gyms, KTVs, parks). The presence of government agencies (court, police station, etc.) suggests it also serves as an administrative center. Healthcare facilities (hospitals, clinics, pharmacies) are also prominent. Food and beverage services are well represented by a variety of restaurants, coffee shops and bakeries.
