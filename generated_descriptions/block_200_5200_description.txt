The area defined by the provided coordinates exhibits a mixed land use pattern. A significant portion of the POIs are categorized as company enterprises, encompassing diverse sectors such as ship engineering, concrete production, construction materials, and agricultural cooperatives. The presence of agricultural entities (farms and cooperatives) alongside industrial companies suggests a potential interface between agricultural and industrial activities. Additionally, the area includes a limited number of commercial services, represented by supermarkets, convenience stores, and pharmacies. Recreational facilities, including a net cafe and agricultural tourism locations, are also present, albeit in a small proportion relative to the industrial and commercial POIs. A logistics center further contributes to the functional diversity of the area.
