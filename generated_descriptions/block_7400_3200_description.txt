The area is characterized by a mix of agricultural, industrial, commercial, and residential functions. A significant portion of the POIs are related to the agricultural sector, including numerous companies and bases specializing in horticulture and gardening (e.g., "上海菊紫园艺有限公司", "阿里山花卉浦南种植基地"). This is further supported by the presence of multiple flower markets and related shopping services. Industrial activities are represented by factories and companies dealing in products such as橡塑制品厂(rubber and plastic products), and building materials. Commercial activities are focused on retail related to horticulture and gardening. Several bus stops suggest the presence of public transportation infrastructure. There are also some temples and tourism sites. Residential elements are present, indicated by residential-related POIs.
