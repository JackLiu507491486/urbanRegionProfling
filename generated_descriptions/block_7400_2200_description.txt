The area is characterized by a mix of industrial, agricultural, residential, and public service functions. A significant number of POIs are related to company enterprises, including factories, manufacturing, and agricultural-related businesses. Transportation infrastructure is also prominent, evidenced by numerous bus stops and parking lots. The presence of government institutions and community service centers suggests a residential component. Limited retail and service businesses, such as convenience stores, restaurants, and auto-related services, are scattered throughout the area. There are also some accommodation services available. The presence of a cemetery (indicated by the "浦南陵园" bus stops) suggests an additional function related to memorial services.
