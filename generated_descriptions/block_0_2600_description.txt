The area defined by the coordinates [121.165835, 31.604331] - [121.186559, 31.622668] contains a limited number of identified Points of Interest (POIs). The POIs indicate a mixed-use area with elements of transportation infrastructure and community organization. Specifically, a bus stop (建桥西桥(公交站)) suggests the presence of public transportation services. The presence of a professional cooperative (上海清澄果蔬专业合作社) indicates some level of organized community or agricultural activity within the area. The limited number of POIs prevents a more detailed characterization.
