The area is characterized by a mix of transportation infrastructure, residential zones, commercial activities, and recreational facilities. A significant portion of the POIs are related to transportation, particularly Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport Terminal 1 and associated facilities such as arrival/departure gates, parking lots (public and private), bus stops, and a subway station. There is also a notable presence of companies, particularly those involved in aviation services and related industries.

Residential areas, including apartment complexes, villas and community centers, are interspersed with commercial establishments such as convenience stores, supermarkets, and specialized shops. Recreational facilities are represented by the Shanghai Zoo, fitness centers, KTVs, and a cultural center. Furthermore, there are a number of hotels and lodging options within the area. The spatial layout suggests a mixed-use area serving both the airport and the local residential population.
