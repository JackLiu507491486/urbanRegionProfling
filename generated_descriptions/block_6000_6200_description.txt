Recreational areas such as fishing locations, ecological gardens, and a resort are also present. Transportation is supported by bus stops, parking lots, and traffic service intersections. Local shopping is supported by convenience stores and construction material stores. Public facilities are supported by public restrooms and a funeral home. The spatial layout appears mixed, with industrial, agricultural, recreational, and residential points of interest interspersed.
